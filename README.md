# Reproducing DryIoc.ContainerException in Azure

This repository contains source code supporting the article at https://mikaberglund.com/dryioc-containerexception-in-azure-functions-application-when-deployed-to-azure.

The [`before-fix`](https://github.com/MikaBerglund/reproducing-DryIoc.ContainerException-in-azure/tree/before-fix) tag contains the application when it still was causing the error described in the article above. Then I rewrote the problematic part and added the [`after-fix`](https://github.com/MikaBerglund/reproducing-DryIoc.ContainerException-in-azure/tree/after-fix) tag.
